Each subject has its own register of language that can be referred to as the ‘academic language’ of that subject. Academic language is a key tool used for learning subject content and for improving the capacity to think about and work with subject content concepts. Most learners learning through an additional language require support throughout their education to become proficient users of (second or third language) academic language, and to become proficient learners of subject content through an additional language. In a trilingual education context, the development of first language academic language also requires systematic attention to ensure that the reduced time allotted to learning through the first language is used effectively and efficiently.\r\n\r\nLanguage objectives are an important tool used in planning for and managing the learning of academic language. Clear and concise language objectives explain to learners what is expected of them. In addition, language objectives help teachers and learners to build, to measure and to maintain the motivation to learn. Subject teachers who maintain a consistent, dual focus on subject content and academic language learning help learners to do the same and to better manage the learning of both.\r\n\r\nTo support the learning of academic language, it is suggested that teachers systematically incorporate the following teaching objectives into lesson plans:\r\n\r\n- **Making visible and drawing learners’ attention to academic language** (e.g. vocabulary including terminology and sets of phrases required to achieve the subject learning objectives)\r\n- **Providing learners with the classroom language needed for working with subject content concepts** (e.g. phrases required for doing group work, posing inquiry questions, analyzing a situation and conducting discussions/debates)\r\n- **Pre-teaching and pre-using in a meaningful context vocabulary** including terminology and sets of phrases required to master the use of content concepts\r\n- **Having learners use all four language skills** in a variety of combinations (e.g. reading-listening, reading-writing, reading-speaking, listening-writing, etc.) for a variety of meaningful purposes\r\n- **Engaging learners in exploratory dialogue** (e.g. avoiding answers to questions that simply demonstrate knowledge and instead using knowledge for sustained discussion, and providing rich language scaffolding so learners can sustain dialogue)\r\n- **Teaching learning skills specific to language** (e.g. selective listening, asking for clarification, developing metalinguistic and metacognitive awareness, paraphrasing, dictionary skills)\r\n- **Encouraging critical thinking about language** (e.g. comparing languages, prompting learners to use language more precisely, assessing progress in learning language)\r\n- **Setting a language objective at the start of a lesson** and discussing progress made in achieving it at the end of a lesson.\r\n\r\nA sample language objective for a subject learning objective is provided in each course plan unit. The sample language objective also includes some of the academic language that learners need support in noticing, using, and learning. This language is shown under the headings:\r\n\r\n1. **Subject-specific vocabulary and terminology**\r\n2. **Useful set(s) of phrases for dialogue/writing**\r\n\r\nMaking this language clear to learners will help them to achieve both the subject content and language learning objectives.\r\n\r\nOther language objectives can be created using, for example, the following words: analyze, categorize, choose, classify, compare, connect, contrast, copy, create, critique, define, describe, elaborate, evaluate, explain why, give examples, hypothesize, identify, justify, negotiate, predict, produce, propose alternative solutions, provide reasons why, redefine, reorganize, rephrase, retell, revise, rewrite, role-play, summarize, synthesize, and write, use for different purposes, write in own words a definition of... and illustrate this.\r\n\r\nEven though some of the language objectives could also be considered subject content objectives, the act of separating out content and language will help learners to maintain a dual focus on both content and language. It will also help counterbalance the attention given to answers/solutions versus processes used to find answers/solutions. Focusing on those processes will support the exact use of language and increased precision in thinking.\r\n\r\nIn a subject class, most learning objectives would be content-focused, yet at least one would be language-focused.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### 1st Quarter\r\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"full\">\r\n  <thead>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <th>№</th>\r\n      <th>Theme</th>\r\n      <th>Goals</th>\r\n      <th>Number of hours</th>\r\n      <th>Date-1</th>\r\n      <th>Date-2</th>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </thead>\r\n  <tbody>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td colspan=\"6\"><strong>1A: Artificial Intelligence (12 hours)</strong></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td>1-4</td>\r\n      <td>Artificial Intelligence</td>\r\n      <td>12.4.3.1. describe spheres where artificial intelligence is applied: industry, education, medicine, gaming industry, society.</td>\r\n      <td>4</td>\r\n      <td></td>\r\n      <td></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td>5-10</td>\r\n      <td>Artificial Intelligence.
